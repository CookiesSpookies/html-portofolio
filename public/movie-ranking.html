<h1>My Favorite Movies Of All Time</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Movies I Really Love</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Spirited Away</h3>
<p>
  This is the best anime movie ever made by Ghibli Studio. I really like the
  story and i ship Chihiro and Haku so much. I hope there is a continuation of
  this movie but i guess it's a vain hope.

<h3>2. Strong Woman Do Bong Soon</h3>
<p>
  The best korean series i ever watch. i love the relatioinship of the male lead
  and female lead. They are the cutest puppy couple i ever seen in a drama.
</p>
<h3>3. Avatar: The Way Of Water</h3>
<p>
  The best fantasy movie i ever seen. I really love the fantasy detail they put
  like the landscape, the animal, and all the species in the avatar world. It is
  so magical and i really love to seen more of this movie.
